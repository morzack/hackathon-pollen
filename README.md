# hackathon-pollen

Project for packhacks 2019 to display pollen counts in an area in an easy to interpret way

Health data sourced from: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index)

## App/Website

The website should be able to pull data from either the physical component or some online API that gets data.
It should present the data to the use in an easy to interpret way -- If on a phone push notifications warning of high pollen count could be useful.

## Physical component

The physical component will be some kind of sensor stand that can connect to teh internet to help provide more specialized data.
It would need to have an IOT board, housing, and sensor.
